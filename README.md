# SuperNotes
Advanced notepad for works that require you to execute stuff from many different document files. I created this to help me to execute campaigns. Might be a bit too not so user friendly, as this was created for my personal taste. 
But feel free to download and edit to suit you.

1. Add name and time of campaign, click languages that you need.
2. Click "landing page"

And thats how you start.

xSplitx button adds places where you want the pasted document to be cut in segments. When you have added those "xSplitx", then "categorize a pasted
copy after setting split points" button will categorize them to right places.

However, if you do not work in exactly same place, doing exactly same job as me or my few co-workers right now, you need to do lots of
modifications to this to suit your need. But hopefully this is handy for someone

Enjoy
